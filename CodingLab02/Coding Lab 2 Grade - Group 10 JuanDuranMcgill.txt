1/3 - understanding of Hubble flow and peculiar velocity - not usually a valid assumption, no explanation
2/2 - Using matplotlib; estimate Age using Plank.age() function
2/2 - Using z_at_value() function; maths of subtracting his/her age
5/6 - Basic knowledge of Hubble–Lemaître law; order-of-magnitude calculation - did not answer if we really need to use Astropy
18/18 - Matplotlib use;final plot; estimate age using different cosmologies; basic code structure - note, use the same bounds as the original plot
12/15 - Matplotlib use;final plot; use of Planck15.luminosity_distance() and Planck15.angular_diameter_distance(z) - plot is incorrect, the lines are not what they should be
1/4 - D(A) starts decreasing (optional: non-linear distance scale) - described incorrect behaviour
13/15 - matplotlib use;final plot; loadin data; converting to (m-M) values; basic code structure - plot is very messy, difficult to observe any trends
4/4 - Existence of a pull request + merged into main branch
